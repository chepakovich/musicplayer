# Music Player Built With React
The music player allows searching for songs by artist on iTunes and playing previews of selected songs. It is built as a simple gadget, but "under the hood" it is set for easy scaling up into a sophisticated application. It is built with React, Redux, Redux Thunk, Axios and custom CSS (the web page is responsive).

## Supported browsers
The app was extensively tested on Google Chrome - Version 73.0.3683.86 (Official Build) (64-bit).

## Supported features
- Search for songs by artist on iTunes (the number of songs returned with each search is arbitrarily set to 10). A search is initiated after at least 3 characters are entered into the search field and is updated with each additional character.
- Search results are presented in the form of a list.
- Each songâ€™s title, artist, album and album art are displayed.
- When a song is selected, it begins to play in a media player. On a small screen the media player pops up at the bottom of the screen. On a larger (desktop) screen it will be shown in the right pane under the album art (large image).
- The right pane also displays a list of other songs of the selected song's album (they are not "clickable").
- Selected song is highlited in the left pane and is marked with a small loudspeaker image.
- A user can perform other searches while the song they selected continues to play.
